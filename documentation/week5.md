# Week 5
## What did I do this week?
I made changes to the structure in the KeyGeneration class, made key generation functions and implemented the class 
responsible for encrypting and decrypting messages. I also updated some tests for the KeyGeneration class and wrote 
tests for the Crypt class.

## Progression of the program
Algorithms required by the program are finished along with other core functionalities of the program.

## What did I learn this week?
Key generation, encrypting and decrypting messages.

## Problems / what is unclear?
I need to find out what sufficient performance testing is like for Miller-Rabin test.

## What next?
Implement UI for the program, test the performance of implemented algorithms. Improve documentation when the program 
itself is finished.
