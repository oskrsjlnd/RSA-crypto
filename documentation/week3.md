# Week 3
## What did I do this week?
Nothing.

## Progression of the program
No progress.

## What did I learn this week?
Miller-Rabin primality test

## Problems / what is unclear?
Nothing this week.

## What next?
Continue with utilities for key generation, most likely will implement Miller-Rabin primality
test and if I have enough time implement Extended Euclidean algorithm and do more testing.
I plan to also get started with the testing document.
