# Week 1
## What did I do this week?
This week I read about the RSA cryptosystem and the algorithms required to implement it.
I setup the repository and wrote the design document. I also made a schedule on which days
I will be working on the project and set aside some extra time if required.

## Progression of the program
No progression as of now.

## What did I learn this week?
I learned about cryptography and how RSA cryptosystem can be applied to encrypt messages.
I also learned the requirements for implementing the system.

## Problems / what is unclear?
It is still unclear to me where I should begin and if the scope of my project fills the
requirements set for this course. However, for the where I should begin part I know it
will become clear next week!

## What next?
Begin by designing appropriate structure for the project. Then choose an algorithm, read 
literature on it and start writing some code.
