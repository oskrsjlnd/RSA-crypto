# Week 6
## What did I do this week?
I fixed Miller-Rabin which I found out did not work as intended. Wrote more comprehensive
testing for the algorithms to see they are functioning properly.

## Progression of the program
Functionalities are finished and there is a simple interface to use the program with.

## What did I learn this week?
What mistakes I made with Miller-Rabin.

## Problems / what is unclear?
No problems here.

## What next?
Finish UI and run performance tests for the program. Finish documentation and bring the
project to a satisfactory state.
