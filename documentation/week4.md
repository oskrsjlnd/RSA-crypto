# Week 4
## What did I do this week?
Implement the Miller Rabin and Extended Euclidean algorithm.

## Progression of the program
Most of the algorithmic work is done.

## What did I learn this week?
Miller-Rabin primality test, Extended Euclidean algorithm.

## Problems / what is unclear?
Tests are not done properly yet.

## What next?
Finish algorithms and tests, write test document and generate keys for encryption. Implement encryption
and decryption.
