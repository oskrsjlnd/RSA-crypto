# Week 2
## What did I do this week?
Setup Poetry, GitHub Actions, Codecov and Pylint. I learned about the Sieve of Eratosthenes
and implemented utilities class with a function to find all the primes up to n (based on
Sieve of Eratosthenes). I also wrote the tests for existing utilities. I also added
explanations on the variables used for time and space complexities in the design document.

## Progression of the program
Utility for finding all prime numbers implemented. Testing is comprehensive so far.

## What did I learn this week?
I learned about the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

## Problems / what is unclear?
No problems, but a bit unclear if it is allowed to use existing libraries for testing if my
algorithm works correctly.

## What next?
Continue with utilities for key generation, most likely will implement Miller-Rabin primality
test and if I have enough time implement Extended Euclidean algorithm and do more testing.
I plan to also get started with the testing document.
